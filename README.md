# FIFA-world-cup-2018  

This repository contains FIFA World Cup 2018 data which I compiled from various websites.  

- `World_cup_2018_country.csv`: Ranking data on the 32 countries which made it to Russia. Rankings are as of 2018-06-07, and were taken from `https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html`.  
- `World_cup_2018_matches.csv`: Summary statistics for each match. Data taken from Google answer boxes, which seems to take data from `foxsports.com`.  
- `World_cup_2018_goals.csv`: Each line in this dataset is a goal that was scored at World Cup 2018. Data taken from Google answer boxes, which seems to take data from `foxsports.com`.
